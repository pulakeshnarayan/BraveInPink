    <h2>About Brave In Pink</h2>
    <p>
      Brave In Pink was born out of love, pain, and a relentless drive to make a difference. Our founders witnessed firsthand the emotional and financial toll of breast cancer on individuals and families in our community. This organization is our response — a beacon of hope, a place of unity, and a platform for action. We aim to raise awareness, provide support, and fund accessible care across our state. Through education, fundraising, and direct outreach, we believe we can create a tangible change in the lives of those affected.
